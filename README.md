Healthcare Problem: Declining Birth Rates across Scotland 
Problem Overview: In recent years, research shows there is decline in live 
childbirth rates across many regions of Scotland. This shift can have long-term 
impact over healthcare planning, resource allocation, and community services, 
as decline in birth rates may lead to an aging population and a shrinking 
workforce. 
Understanding this trend is very crucial for healthcare providers, policymakers, 
and community planners to adapt strategies that support families and potentially 
reverse or manage this decline. 
Target Audience: 
 Healthcare providers: To provide maternity and paediatric services more 
effectively. 
 Policymakers: To manage healthcare budgets, welfare policies, and long
term population sustainability strategies. 
 Community planners: Ensure to provide proper infrastructure for 
schools, childcare services, and employment opportunities. 
Data Needed: 
To illustrate this healthcare issue, we will need the following data: 
1. Live birth rates: by health board and year (which is already available in 
the dataset). 
2. Population data: for each health board to calculate trends relative to 
population changes. 
3. Socioeconomic factors: (e.g., income, employment rates, access to 
healthcare) for each region to explore connection between birth rates and 
external factors. 
4. Age demographics: To identify trends such as population aging or 
migration effects that affects birth rates. 
Data Visualisation: 
Appropriate Visualisation: A multi-layered visualisation is done to show birth 
rate trend across Scotland. To describe effective decline trend in birth rate. 
Correlation Scatterplot: A scatterplot shows correlations between birth rates 
and other factors represent the factors that affecting birth rates and its trend such 
as income, education level, and access to healthcare. 
The dataset you uploaded contains information on live births for various health 
boards in Scotland. Here is a breakdown of its structure: 
 area_code: A unique identifier for health board. 
 area_type: Describes the geographic entity 
 area_name: Name of the health board. 
 year: The year of the data point. 
 period: specifying calendar year. 
 type_definition: Defines the rate type, "Crude rate per 1,000 population." 
 indicator: Type of event being measured i.e., "Live births." 
 numerator: The number of live births. 
 measure: The crude birth rate per 1,000 population. 
 upper_confidence_interval: confidence interval for the birth rates upper 
limit. 
 lower_confidence_interval: confidence interval for the birth rates lower 
limit. 
Purpose: This visualization of above chart will help finding insights of birth 
rate fluctuation across health board of Scotland, which is influenced by to 
underlying factors, policymakers take effective decisions. 
A scattered plot describes the fall in the trend of live birth across different health 
board of the country.
